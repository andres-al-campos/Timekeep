#
# GENERATED from walled_garden/_template/ios-build.sh — edit that and re-run
# walled_garden/sync-build-scripts.sh, or the next sync overwrites this file.
# It is committed here anyway so the project stays standalone: each of these is
# its own repo, and a script sourced from a shared parent would be missing from
# every clone.
#
# Standalone: needs only Xcode's command-line tools and an Apple ID signed in
# to Xcode (Settings → Accounts). No Sideloadly, no ReSign, no Xcode GUI build.
# ReSign can also build this project on its own for auto-renewal, but it is not
# required — this script is the self-contained path.
#
# Usage:
#   ./build.sh                 # build, sign, install to connected iPhone (default)
#   ./build.sh --no-install    # build + sign only, stage into ./build/Timekeep.app
#   ./build.sh -n              # short form of --no-install
#   ./build.sh --device <id>   # target a specific device (else first available)
#   ./build.sh -v              # verbose xcodebuild output
